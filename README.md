Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and how we keep it safe.

## 2. Data Collection

Yabby does **not collect any personal data**. The extension only uses permissions necessary for its functionality:

- **Alarms** – to schedule recurring reminders for eye breaks.
- **Notifications** – to alert you when it’s time to rest your eyes.
- **Storage** – to save user preferences like reminder intervals and notification settings.
- **Tabs** – only to detect active browsing so reminders appear at the right time.
- **Remote resources** – limited to static updates; no executable remote code is run.

**Important:** Yabby does **not** access, collect, or share browsing history, passwords, or any other personal information.
